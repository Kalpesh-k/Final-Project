# Final-Project
The purpose of project: I wanted to improve my skills with Python and Jupyter Notebook. This project allowed me to use a variety of libraries such as numpy, pandas, and sk-learn, and then recommends movies using cosine similarity. I wanted to explore data cleaning, and how recommendation systems work. This project was an amazing experience .
Movies Recommendation System
This Project repository is based on Building a movies recommendation system clone
Dataset Details:
The Dataset used for building this recommendation engine is mentioned as below:

Dataset used : MovieLens dataset
Download Dataset : Download Dataset from these following links
Download MovieLens dataset hosted on Kaggle then use kaggle link
Download MovieLens dataset from its official website then use GroupLens link
Dataset File Format : CSV File (Comma-separated values). NOTE: Download and save dataset inside input_data folder
Types of dataset :
The full dataset : This dataset consists of 26,000,000 ratings and 750,000 tag applications applied to 45,000 movies by 270,000 users. Includes tag genome data with 12 million relevance scores across 1,100 tags.
NOTE: We will build a simple Recommendation for movies using The full dataset.
The small dataset : This dataset comprises of 100,000 ratings and 1,300 tag applications applied to 9,000 movies by 700 users.
NOTE: All personalised recommender systems will make use of the small dataset (due to the limited computing power of our system).
Data description : It contains 100004 ratings and 1296 tag applications across 9125 movies. These data were created by 671 users between January 09, 1995 and October 16, 2016. This dataset was generated on October 17, 2016.Users were selected at random for inclusion. All selected users had rated at least 20 movies. No demographic information is included. Each user is represented by an id, and no other information is provided.
